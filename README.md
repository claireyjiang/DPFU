# Crab: Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning

## About The Project

## Generate the dataset
For example, if want to generate the MNIST, you can use
```
python generate_mnist.py iid - - # for iid and unbalanced scenario
# python generate_mnist.py iid balance - # for iid and balanced scenario
# python generate_mnist.py noniid - pat # for pathological noniid and unbalanced scenario
# python generate_mnist.py noniid - dir # for practical noniid and unbalanced scenario
```
Note: the file is 'add' mode, so notice to delete the original split files before generate the dataset.
